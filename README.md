🔍 Char Google Search Engine – HTML & CSS Demo Project Overview: This project is a front-end demo of a simple custom search engine interface built using HTML and CSS. The main feature of this project is the integration of a Google Custom Search Engine (CSE), allowing users to perform real-time web searches through a styled interface. It simulates the look and feel of a search engine homepage while focusing on responsive design and aesthetic presentation.

💡 Key Features: Google Custom Search Integration: Embedded a Google CSE script using a valid cx key to enable live search functionality directly from the web page.

Responsive Layout: Designed to be mobile-friendly using media queries for optimal viewing on various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

Modern UI Design: Includes a visually appealing background image, animated content fade-in effect, and clean, soft shadows for a card-like container. Uses a consistent color scheme with CSS variables for easier customization.

User Interface Elements:

Search bar with styled input and button

Header and footer sections

A brief description/content section

Custom Styling: Utilizes modern CSS features including variables (:root), transitions, animations (@keyframes), and flexbox layout.

🧱 Technologies Used: HTML5: For page structure

CSS3: For styling, animations, layout, and responsiveness

Google CSE: For embedded search functionality

📁 Project Structure: bash Copy Edit /project-root │ ├── index.html # Main HTML file ├── style.css # Custom CSS stylesheet 📜 How It Works: A user enters a query in the search input box.

The input is handled by the embedded Google Custom Search Engine (via JavaScript snippet).

Results are dynamically displayed within the same layout.

The rest of the page serves as a template, simulating how a custom search engine could look.

🚀 Future Improvements (Optional): Add JavaScript to handle custom search queries or animations.

Store and display search history.

Enable filtering results by category.

Add more pages or links to simulate a full search experience.
